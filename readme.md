# üß† Denoising of MRI Images using CNN

**A CNN-based Approach to Denoise MRI Scans**

## üöÄ Overview

This project presents a convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture for the blind denoising of brain MRI images. The model leverages two key blocks: a **SuperResolution** module to upscale images and a **Denoiser** to enhance image quality while restoring the original dimensions. By combining these techniques, the model achieves superior performance in terms of image quality compared to traditional autoencoder-based methods.

## üõ†Ô∏è How It Works

1. **Input**: Original MRI image size is **(112, 112, 3)**.
2. **SuperResolution Block**: Upscales the input image to **(224, 224, 3)**.
3. **Denoiser Block**: Denoises the upscaled image while downscaling it back to the original dimensions **(112, 112, 3)**.
4. **Output**: The final image is cleaner and free from noise, significantly improving MRI quality.

This combination of upscaling and downscaling not only denoises but also retains critical features in the brain MRI scans.

## üìä Comparisons & Results

The model was trained on **5,712 MRI images** and tested on two separate test sets of **3,762** and **1,311 images**, respectively.

- **Proposed Model (denoiser_enhancer)**:
  - **PSNR**: 31.5 (Test Set 1), 36.0 (Test Set 2)
  - **Model Size**: 3,674 KB

- **Autoencoder Model (denoiser)**:
  - **PSNR**: 28.5 (Test Set 1), 33.3 (Test Set 2)
  - **Model Size**: 2,299 KB

Despite a slightly larger model size, the proposed CNN significantly outperforms the autoencoder, offering a **+3 PSNR improvement** on both datasets while keeping the model lightweight.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used

- **TensorFlow** and **Keras** for model building and training.
- **Sci-Kit Learn** and **OpenCV** for data preprocessing and augmentation.

## üìà Performance Metrics

- **PSNR (Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio)** is used as the primary metric for image quality assessment.
- The model demonstrates a considerable leap in PSNR, indicating clearer and more accurate MRI images post-denoising.
